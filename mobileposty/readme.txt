MobilePosty lets you re-organize and redesign your existing content into a custom site optimized for mobile browsers.

MobilePosty: A smaller screen, a bigger opportunity.

== Description ==

By now, we're all hip to the idea that someone visiting your site from a mobile browser is probably looking for something very different than someone visiting your site from a static connection. Mobile users are by and large looking for one bit of information--contact info, directions, opening hours, etc. They are after something discreet and specific, and they want it displayed in a very attractive way, optimized for a small screen.

That's what MobilePosty does. You can select from your existing content what you would like highlighted for mobile users, and you can apply one of our mobile themes so that it is visually optimized as well.

Our content selection interface gives you complete control over your content and how it displays to mobile users. It gives options to assign homepage status to a different page than your full site. It also allows you to customize display settings for image size, author/date information, and any specific category, page, or post.

Our custom mobile themes are clean, easily editable, and allow you to upload a header image so that your mobile visitors see your brand and recognize your attention to them.


== Installation ==

Step 1: Download the plugin files from mobiah.com/mobileposty/download/ or from wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mobileposty
Step 2: Upload the wp-mobileposty folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
Step 3: Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q: Will MobilePosty change the content of my pages and posts?

A: In some ways.  MobilePosty provides an option for you to resize images in your content to fit a mobile browser, but other than that, it is left untouched.  So if you have pages where you've put some large tables or perhaps fixed-width divs or spans, you should look at those pages in the mobile browser after enabling the plugin, to be sure they look good.

Q: One of the mobile themes provided is close to what I want.  Can I edit it?

A: Absolutely, if you know anything about CSS.  Go into the mobileposty theme folder, and look in the css sub-folder.  Find the mobile theme file you selected in your MobilePosty theme settings, and edit to your heart's content.

Q: I have one post or page which is not visible, and but I didn't mark it as invisible.  Whuh?

A: If a page seems to be invisible in the mobile site, make sure that none of the parents of that page (or parents of parents) are marked as invisible. If a page is invisible, all of its sub-pages are also invisible in the mobile site.  For posts, look to make sure the categories containing that post are visible, and that those categories' parent categories are also visible.

Q: When I visit my site on my mobile browser, I still see my regular site. What's up?

A: It's possible that you've got a specific phone or browser on your phone which isn't by default recognized by MobilePosty.  Contact us and tell us exactly which phone you're using, and what browser on that phone, and we'll try to include it on our next release.
